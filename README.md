# Perfect React Setup
I need a good way to setup a new react environment. A lot of starting frameworks exist but they change so often and I want to understand every part of the setup repo.

## Installation and Getting Started
**Install Homebrew**
    
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

**Install Node & Yarn**

      brew install node
      brew install yarn
